## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 RFID Authentication (IT01)

**Preconditions:**
- System is running with RFID reader connected
- Test student records exist in the database

**Test Steps:**
1. Start the application
2. Scan a registered RFID card
3. Verify authentication process
4. Verify student dashboard appears
5. Scan an unregistered RFID card
6. Verify error handling

**Expected Results:**
- Registered card allows access to dashboard
- Unregistered card shows appropriate error message
- System logs authentication attempts

### 3.2 MQTT Communication (IT03)

**Preconditions:**
- Central system and faculty desk unit connected to same MQTT broker
- Test faculty records exist in the database

**Test Steps:**
1. Start both central system and faculty desk unit
2. Change faculty status on desk unit
3. Verify status change is reflected in central system
4. Disconnect network and make changes
5. Reconnect network and verify synchronization
6. Test with invalid message formats

**Expected Results:**
- Status changes propagate correctly
- System handles disconnections gracefully
- Invalid messages are properly handled

### 3.3 System Recovery (ST03)

**Preconditions:**
- System fully configured with all components

**Test Steps:**
1. Start the system and establish baseline functionality
2. Disconnect MQTT broker and verify appropriate handling
3. Reconnect MQTT broker and verify recovery
4. Disconnect Firebase and verify offline functionality
5. Reconnect Firebase and verify data synchronization
6. Force unexpected application termination
7. Restart and verify proper state recovery

**Expected Results:**
